# Rosary50.com: The Life of Jesus Rosary

### **TL;DR: The "Director's Cut" of the Rosary**
The standard 15 mysteries of the Rosary are actually a simplified version of the **Carthusian Rosary**, which originally featured a unique mystery for every single Hail Mary. **Rosary50.com** is a 100% free digital restoration of this ancient, Christ-centered tradition.

## 📜 The Story
I used to wonder why we pray 10x more Hail Marys than Our Fathers. I eventually realized that despite the repetitions, the Rosary is profoundly **Christ-focused**. Meditating on these mysteries transformed my spiritual life, leading me to attend weekday Mass and find deeper peace.

### **A Brief History**
* **The Original Form:** Originally, the Rosary had no specific mysteries; it was 150 Hail Marys prayed to mirror the 150 Psalms.
* **The Carthusian Innovation:** In the early 15th century, **Blessed Dominic of Prussia** added *clausulae* (clauses) after the name of Jesus to combat distractions. This "Life of Jesus Rosary" featured 50 (and later 150) unique mysteries.
* **The Simplification:** Because 150 mysteries were too hard for the laity to memorize, **Blessed Alan de la Roche** simplified them into the 15 mysteries (one per decade) we use today.
* **Saintly Endorsement:** Even after the simplification, this "bead-by-bead" method was highly recommended by **St. Louis de Montfort** and **Pope St. John Paul II**.

With modern technology, the "difficulty" of memorizing 50 mysteries is gone. Whether you want to give Our Lady a bouquet of 50 unique roses, explain the Rosary to Protestant friends, or manage **ADHD** during prayer—this app is for you.
